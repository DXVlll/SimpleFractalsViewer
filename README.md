# SimpleFractalsViewer
This is simple fractals viewer. With it you can see (and construct) some of fractals.

This program is based in part on the work of the FLTK project (http://www.fltk.org).

In program you can define transformations and starting figure.
Program by transformations will create new figures from starting figure, remove starting figure and then look at created figures as at starting figure. Then program by transformations will create new figures from starting figure and remove starting figure...
Program will do these actions number of times equal to iterations parameter.
